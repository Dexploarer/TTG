# Mechanics as Story

In LunchTable High, the gameplay mechanics aren't just numbers—they are the narrative manifesting in the TCG.

## Vice: The Unresolved Adulthood

Vice Counters represent the character flaws that have trapped the residents of LunchTable High in this loop. It is the weight of their unresolved adulthood.

- **Gameplay**: Accumulating Vice counters leading to a Breakdown.
- **Story**: As a character's Vice increases, their dialogue changes, their card art begins to fracture, and "flashback fragments" of their adult life appear as UI overlays.

### Breakdown: The Moment of Memory

A Breakdown isn't just a card being destroyed. It’s a moment of clarity so intense it shatters the stereotype mask.

When a Breakdown occurs:
- The screen glitches.
- Voice lines distort.
- Haunting text overlays appear: *"You said you'd quit."*, *"They all moved on."*, *"You were almost someone."*

## Visual Story Progression

The world itself changes as the Player (The Transfer) progresses through the campaign.

1. **Early Campaign (Bright & Nostalgic)**: The cafeteria looks like a classic 90s teen drama. Colors are saturated, and the loop feels "safe."
2. **Mid Campaign (Deepening Shadows)**: Textures begin to distort. The edges of cards look worn or "cracked."
3. **Late Campaign (The Glitch)**: UI glitches are frequent. The halo on high-rarity cards is fractured. The background music slows down or distorts.
4. **Endgame (The Void)**: The cafeteria is empty. Tables are overturned. There is no cheering crowd. Just the reality of the loop.
