# LunchTable High: Core Lore Concept

## The School of Hard Knocks

LunchTable High is not a normal school. It is a **looping dimension** where senior year never ends.

Everyone here is an adult, yet they are trapped reliving their final year over and over. They wear the masks of high school archetypes, but their eyes tell a story of burnout, disappointment, and stagnant potential.

### The Rules of the Loop

- **No one graduates.**
- **No one grows.**
- **Only reputations rise and collapse.**

The cafeteria is the center of reality. Every duel at the LunchTable reshapes the social hierarchy. It is the only place where anything feels like it changes, even if it resets by the next morning.

## The Core Mystery

No one remembers exactly how they got stuck here. But everyone remembers one thing: **They almost made it.**

The star athlete who peaked in the state finals. The valedictorian who couldn't handle the real world. The crypto genius whose wallet was drained. The artist who lost their muse. The dropout who stayed for the wrong reasons.

All of them plateaued, then broke. Now they replay their failures, hoping for a different outcome that never comes.

## World Structure

LunchTable High is divided into several key Zones, each representing a different facet of the purgatory:

- **The Cafeteria**: The main battleground. Where social standing is won and lost through TCG duels.
- **The Lockers**: Secrets and rumors. The quiet spaces where the truth of the loop is discussed in whispers.
- **The Gym**: Reputation trials. Where the physical toll of the loop is most evident.
- **The Parking Lot**: Underground deals. Where things from "outside" sometimes manifest.
- **Detention**: A punishment dimension. Not just a room, but a presence that watches for instability.
- **The Senior Party**: A vice amplification zone. Where characters give in to their flaws to forget the loop.
- **The Hallway**: The graveyard of fallen reputations. Where the "broken" characters wander.
