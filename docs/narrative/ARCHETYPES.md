# Character Archetypes

Each archetype in LunchTable High represents a specific psychological profile—a "Stereotype" that the world forces them to inhabit. Beneath the surface, every character carries a tragic undertone reflecting their unresolved adulthood.

## The Dropout (Red) - The Aggro
**Core Vice: Hustle / Avoidance**
- **Tragedy**: Most of them actually "made it" in the outside world for a brief moment. One mistake, one bad deal, or one instance of bad luck changed their trajectory. Now they act reckless to prove they don't care about the system that rejected them.
- **Key Cards**: *Crypto All-In Carl*, *Back Alley Bookie*.

## The Prep (Blue) - The Midrange
**Core Vice: Validation / Status**
- **Tragedy**: Their entire identity is built on external validation. They are popular because the loop requires them to be, but they can't survive without the cheering crowd. They are terrified of being "normal" or "forgotten."
- **Key Cards**: *Washed Varsity Legend*, *Party Queen Bri*.

## The Geek (Yellow) - The Combo
**Core Vice: Burnout / Isolation**
- **Tragedy**: They know the system is fake. They see the glitches. But they are too scared or too obsessed with their own niche systems to try and break the loop. They burn bright with tech but burn out into loneliness.
- **Key Cards**: *Indie Dev Dropout*, *LAN Party Larry*.

## The Freak (Purple) - The Chaos
**Core Vice: Existentialism / Conspiracy**
- **Tragedy**: They know something is deeply wrong and they embrace the chaos as a distraction. Their unpredictability is a coping mechanism for the crushing clarity they sometimes experience.
- **Key Cards**: *Afterparty Goblin*, *Conspiracy Kyle*.

## The Nerd (Green) - The Control
**Core Vice: Pressure / Perfectionism**
- **Tragedy**: They are trying to calculate an escape, but their own rigidity is the anchor. They believe that if they can just master the rules of the loop, they can command it. They crack under the pressure of their own standards.
- **Key Cards**: *Scholarship Sniper*, *Spreadsheet Assassin*.

## The Goodie-Two-Shoes (White) - The Attrition
**Core Vice: Repression / Morality**
- **Tragedy**: They believe that if they follow the rules perfectly, reality will eventually fix itself. They suppress their vices to the point of breaking, acting as hall monitors for a school that doesn't exist.
- **Key Cards**: *Volunteer Valedictorian*, *Student Council President*.
