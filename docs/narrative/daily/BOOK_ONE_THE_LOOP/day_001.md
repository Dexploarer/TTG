# Day 001: The Transfer

The bell doesn't ring.

It stutters.

A metallic echo that feels delayed, like the building is buffering itself into existence.

You don't remember arriving.

You don't remember freshman year.

You only remember almost making it.

A scholarship letter you never opened. A startup deck you never pitched. A speech you almost gave.

The memory fractures when you try to hold it.

The cafeteria lights flicker once, twice.

Then stabilize into something fluorescent and unforgiving.

Rows of long plastic tables. Blue. Scratched. Chewed at the corners.

Everyone is already seated.

They always are.

The Dropouts at the far left wall—hoodies up, chairs tilted back, betting on something no one else can see.

The Preps in the center—symmetrical, smiling too hard, pretending the symmetry means control.

The Geeks and Nerds clustered near the windows—laptops open, spreadsheets reflected in their glasses.

The Freaks never sit still.

And at the front, near the doors, an empty chair.

No one looks at it.

But everyone knows it's there.

That's where you wake up.

---

A tray slides in front of you.

On it: a card.

Your Stereotype.

The art is crisp. The stats glow faintly.

**Reputation:** 1600  
**Stability:** 1500  
**Vice:** Validation

You don't remember choosing it.

But it fits.

---

Across the cafeteria, a Dropout grins at you.

"New kid?"

His card flickers above him like a projection.

**Reputation:** 1900  
**Stability:** 1100  
**Vice:** Gambling

He flips a coin across the table. It spins without ever landing.

"Pick a seat," he says. "Or we'll pick one for you."

The seating chart appears overhead, suspended in the air.

You realize something slowly.

This isn't orientation.

This is territory.

## Event: First Duel

**Trigger:** Any player approaches any occupied table.

**Effect:**  
- Challenger gains +100 Reputation on victory.  
- Loser gains no Vice (clean slate week).  
- The winner's card art develops a hairline crack, barely visible.

**Narrative Note:**  
The Dropout plays "All In." His Reputation doubles. His Stability halves. The cafeteria cheers.

Then he laughs like nothing happened.

But when he turns away, his Stability counter flickers.

1100.

1099.

1100.

The system correcting itself.

Or learning.

## End of Day State

The bell rings six minutes late.

No one reacts.

Tomorrow, it will ring five minutes late.

The day after: four.

By Friday, the bell won't ring at all.

And no one will notice.
