# Day 003: The Audition

Valedictoria Vance has never looked up from her spreadsheet.

The Honor Roll table has coasters. For the milk cartons.

Rules:
1. No elbows on the table (reduces efficiency)
2. No noise above 40 decibels
3. No cards with cost-to-value ratio below 3.7
4. No fun

"Where do you see yourself in five years?" she asks.

You try to answer: "I see myself leaving."

She narrows her eyes.

"Everyone thinks they'll be the one to break the loop. The crypto kids thought their portfolios would buy freedom. The athletes thought glory would carry them out."

She shows you a tab labeled QUARTERLY_MELTDOWN_TRACKER.xlsx

"Column A: Date of crisis. Column B: Trigger. Column C: Duration. Column D: Productivity loss. Column E: Lessons learned."

Column E is blank.

"I was supposed to be at McKinsey by now," she says. "I had the return offer. The Patagonia vest. Then I woke up here and thought: fine. I'll be valedictorian of purgatory."

She removes her glasses. Her eyes are bloodshot from screens.

"But the loop doesn't break. It optimizes WITH you. Every time I get smarter, the loop gets smarter. We're not competing against each other. We're competing against a system that learns from ambition."

## Observation

The other Honor Rollers:

**Percy Perfect** — Never scored below 100%. Currently depressed because "perfection is a plateau, not a peak."

**Debbie Deadline** — Has a countdown tattoo: "847 DAYS UNTIL MEANINGFUL MILESTONE"

**Gary GPA** — Legally changed his name to match his brand. Has business cards.

They all have the same look.

The look of people who achieved everything they were told to achieve and found it was just more cafeteria.
