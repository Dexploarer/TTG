# Day 005: The JV Bench

You find them behind the bleachers.

Not hiding. Just... waiting.

**JV Jimmy. JV Jorge. JV Jamal.**

Same letterman jackets as Chad, but the letters are different. Smaller. Junior Varsity. The B-Team.

"You beat Chad," Jimmy says. Not a question.

"We saw," says Jorge.

"We see everything," says Jamal. "Because no one sees us."

Jimmy hands you a card:

> **"Underdog Syndrome"** — Trap Card. When your Reputation is lower: Double your lowest-cost Stereotype's attack.

"Chad's weakness," Jimmy explains. "He only fears people who look like they could be him. We don't look like that. We look like... practice."

Jorge nods. "We run the same plays. Just worse. We're proof that proximity to greatness doesn't make you great. It just makes you aware of the gap."

Jamal looks at the sky. The sky looks wrong. Too blue. Like a screensaver.

"Chad has a 4,127-0 record in Week One," Jamal says. "But against us? He doesn't even register the matches. We're not opponents. We're background."

## The Secret

They lead you to a storage closet that shouldn't exist behind the bleachers.

Inside: not sports equipment.

Screens.

Dozens of screens, all showing the cafeteria from different angles. Different years.

"We document," Jimmy says. "Every duel. Every breakdown. Every disappearance."

Jorge pulls up footage:

**2009.** A student named... the name glitches... wins the Center Table. Graduates. Walks through the doors.

**Thirteen minutes later:** The same student walks back in. No memory. Same tray. Same apple.

"Subject 891," Jamal whispers. "They graduated perfectly. Zero Vice. Max Reputation. And the loop reset them anyway."

Jimmy looks at you.

"You're Subject 892. The Variable. The Transfer Student card has no fixed stats. It evolves based on what breaks you."

He shows you a spreadsheet:

| Subject | Loops Survived | Vice Type | Status |
|---------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| 001-890 | Various | Various | [REDACTED] |
| 891 | 47 | Perfectionism | RESET |
| 892 | 1 | ??? | ACTIVE |

"Forty-seven loops," Jorge says. "Forty-seven perfect runs. And the system still said: 'not enough.'"

## The Warning

"The loop isn't punishment," Jamal says. "It's comfort."

He gestures at the screens. All those years. All those students.

"Adulthood waits beyond the doors. Failure waits there. Irrelevance. In here? You can always try again. You can always be almost someone."

Jimmy hands you a key.

"The Janitor's closet. Third floor. Don't go there yet. But when you need to know what's cleaning the halls..."

He doesn't finish.

The bell rings.

It rings on time.

For the first time all week.

That's somehow worse.
