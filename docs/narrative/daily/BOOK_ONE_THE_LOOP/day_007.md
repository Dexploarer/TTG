# Day 007: The Déjà Vu (Week 2 Begins)

The bell rings.

It rings five minutes late.

Yesterday it rang on time.

The day before: six minutes late.

The pattern isn't patterning.

---

## The Tables Have Moved

You're certain the Preps were on the left.

Now they're center-right.

The Geeks claim they didn't move, but their laptops are all showing the same loading icon. They've been loading since Saturday.

Nate approaches you.

Same grin as Day One.

"New kid?"

Same words.

But something in his eyes—

Recognition.

Not of you.

Of the situation.

"You feel it too," he says. Not a question.

"The déjà vu. The tables shifting. The bell not knowing when to ring."

He sits. He never sits.

"We're in Month One. Freshman Year. But I've been here before. We've all been here before. We just don't remember until Month Two."

He shows you his card.

There's a crack in the art now.

Barely visible.

"Every loop, I find you. Every loop, I say the same things. Every loop, you either beat me or you don't. And every loop, I'm back here on Day Seven saying 'New kid?' like it's the first time."

He laughs. It sounds like a file corrupting.

"But this time, I wrote something down."

---

## The Note

He pulls a folded paper from his pocket.

In his handwriting. Shaky. Like he wrote it while dreaming.

> "Day 847. The Transfer is the Variable. They don't remember the loops because they're new each time. But they're the only ones who can break it. Because they haven't optimized yet. Because they still make mistakes."

> "The system wants optimization. Wants perfect play. Wants agents who learn and adapt and become efficient."

> "But efficiency is the trap. The perfect loop is the prison."

> "The exit isn't winning. It's failing spectacularly. It's being so unpredictable that the system can't calibrate."

Nate looks at you.

"Last loop, you tried that. You played nothing but Trap cards. No Stereotypes. No attacks. Just Traps. For three weeks."

"What happened?" you ask.

"The cafeteria glitched. The walls turned inside out. The Principal appeared early. And then—"

He stops.

"—then the loop reset. And I found myself on Day One again. With this note in my pocket. And a crack in my card."

---

## The Audition

**Student Government nominations today.**

**Open Mic Night tonight.**

**Dueling permits +100 Reputation for victories.**

**First loss: +1 Vice.**

The mechanic shifts.

Last week, losing meant nothing. This week, losing stains you.

Vice isn't dramatic.

It's subtle.

A glow at the edge of your card.

A whisper:

"They noticed you fail."

---

## Observation

The Honor Roll table is auditioning for leadership positions.

Valedictoria is giving a speech about "synergistic cafeteria optimization."

No one is listening.

But her Reputation rises anyway.

The Preps are campaigning for "Most Likely to Succeed."

The position is ceremonial.

The title hasn't been awarded since 2009.

The Freaks are performing poetry at the Open Mic.

Conspiracy Kyle reads a piece called "The Cafeteria Is Recursive."

No one reacts.

But the lights flicker when he says "recursive."

---

## End of Day

The bell doesn't ring.

It just—stops.

The hum of the cafeteria continues.

The milk dispensers gurgle.

The fluorescent lights buzz.

And somewhere, a counter you can't see clicks from 99 to 98.

You don't know what the counter counts.

But you feel the absence.

Like a chair removed from a circle.

Like a name forgotten.

Like the space where someone stood, before they didn't.
