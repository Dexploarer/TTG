# Day 004: The Party (Week 3 Begins Early)

The doors to the parking lot slide open.

No announcement.

No one needs to.

The first party is a ritual.

---

The parking lot isn't a parking lot.

It extends further than geometry allows. Cars from decades that don't match. A '72 Impala next to a Tesla Cybertruck. Both rusted. Both with engines running. No drivers.

The Freaks are already there.

They never wait for permission.

**Stacy Status** sits on a hood, playing a card called "Villain Era." Her Reputation fluctuates wildly, like a stock chart during a crash. She smiles at the volatility.

"You want to sit with us?" she asks. "We don't duel for Rep. We duel for chaos. We break the meta. We play cards that shouldn't work together until they do."

She gestures to the Drama Section crew.

**Conspiracy Kyle** is explaining to a tree that the cafeteria is a simulation. The tree is listening.

**Afterparty Goblin** is eating something that glows. No one asks what.

**Emo Emma** is writing poetry on her arm in Sharpie. The words keep changing. You catch a phrase: "the loop learns your trauma in real-time."

## Event: Vice Unlocked

**Trigger:** Entering the parking lot.

**Effect:**  
Vice types activate:
- **Alcohol** — Cards that buff then crash
- **Validation** — Cards that require crowd approval
- **Gambling** — Cards with coin flip mechanics

**First Vice Counter:**  
When you play your first Vice card, you feel it.

Not dramatic.

Subtle.

A glow at the edge of your card.

A whisper: "They noticed you."

## The Disappearance

Across the lot, someone laughs too hard.

Someone throws up behind the bleachers.

Someone disappears.

Not explodes. Not fades.

Just—absence.

Where they stood: an empty space. The grass doesn't grow there anymore.

No one mentions it the next day.

The cafeteria population counter, if you could see it, would read:

**99.**

But you can't see it yet.

You're not supposed to know you're counting down.
