# Day 006: Weekend - The First "Good"

The cafeteria doesn't empty on weekends.

It transforms.

The fluorescent lights dim to a warmer spectrum. Not warm like sunlight. Warm like a computer screen in a dark room.

The Seating Chart freezes. No challenges. No duels.

Just... maintenance.

## The Lunch Lady

She appears at your table.

Not beside you. Just—at the table. She was already there. You didn't notice.

Her name tag: **MILUNCHLADY**  
Below it: **CLASS OF ∞**

"Week One ends tomorrow," she says. Not unkindly.

She places something on your tray:

A yearbook.

**LunchTable High. Class of 2009.**

"Open it," she says.

You do.

Every page is the same photo.

Different faces. Same pose. Same cafeteria. Same date.

August 2009.

September 2009.

December 2009.

June 2010.

All the same.

All labeled: **"Voted Most Likely To Leave."**

None of them left.

## The Center Table

She gestures to the empty throne at the front.

"Someone has to sit there eventually," she says. "The system requires a monarch. Someone to absorb the pressure. Someone to be the target."

"Why empty?" you ask.

"Because the last one who sat there... optimized too well. They figured out the loop. Understood every rule. Exploited every weakness."

She smiles. It's not comforting.

"They graduated. Walked out the doors. Found a job. A life. Grew old."

She pauses.

"Then woke up back here. Age 17. Full memory intact."

"What happened?" you ask.

"They sat at the Center Table. They became the Principal."

## The Choice

"Tomorrow," she says, "Week Two begins. Tryouts. Auditions. The pressure increases."

"But today," she slides a card across the table, "you choose your first memory."

The card is blank. Waiting.

"Think of something from before. Something you almost achieved. The system will... incorporate it."

Your options:

**The Scholarship** — Add "Student Debt" card to your deck (high cost, devastating late-game).

**The Startup** — Add "Pivot" card (reroll any failed play, but lose Stability each use).

**The Relationship** — Add "Closure" card (powerful, but can only be played once).

**The Silence** — Add nothing. Stay unpredictable. The system hates unpredictable.

Whatever you choose, she writes it in the yearbook.

Next to your photo.

Your photo that wasn't there yesterday.

## End of Week One

The cafeteria hums with potential energy.

Week Two waits.

The seating chart will shift. The duels will escalate. Vice will accumulate.

But tonight, for one evening, the loop pauses.

Not for rest.

For calibration.

The system is learning you.

By Week Four, it will know you better than you know yourself.
