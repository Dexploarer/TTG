# Day 002: The Chart

The seating chart is laminated.

Heavy lamination. The kind that suggests permanence even though you watched Nate move tables twice yesterday.

The Chart hovers in the center of the cafeteria, rotating slowly.

Tier 1: Center Table. Empty. Waiting.

Tier 2: The Archetype Tables. Occupied. Contested.

Tier 3: The Fringe. The Dropout Corner. Unmarked territory.

Tier 4: [REDACTED]

You try to read Tier 4. The words swim. They rearrange into your own name, then someone else's, then a string of numbers that might be coordinates or a countdown.

Captain Chad Bradley hasn't sat down since 2009.

His letterman jacket has patches from games that never happened.

State Finals 2008. The patch is just a question mark that sweats.

"I peaked," he tells you, not looking at you, looking through you. "State Finals. I remember winning. Then I remember waking up here."

He does a wall sit while talking.

"Every day. Every year. The Big Game."

He laughs. It sounds like static.

"You want the Varsity Table? Beat me. But know this: I've dueled 4,127 times in Week One. I've never lost. Because Week One is hope. And hope is easy to crush."

## Event: Captain's Challenge

**Trigger:** Player attempts to sit at Varsity Table.

**Boss:** Captain Chad  
**Deck:** All buff spells. "Glory Days" continuous effect.  
**Weakness:** If his Reputation drops below opponent's, his entire strategy collapses.

**Outcome A (Victory):**  
Chad sits down. For the first time since 2009. His knees make a sound like gravel.

"Okay," he says. "I remember losing now."

He walks to the JV section. They make room. They always make room.

**Outcome B (Defeat):**  
Chad doesn't gloat. He just updates a spreadsheet.

"Column A: Every loss. Column B: Why. Column C: How I weaponized the trauma."

12,847 rows.

"Get hurt," he says. "Then get systematic."

## Late Night

If you stay past 3:00 PM, the cafeteria empties. Not gradually—suddenly.

The double doors lead to a hallway that didn't exist this morning.

On the wall, scratched deep:

"THIS ISN'T PURGATORY. PURGATORY HAS EXIT SIGNS."

Below it:

"The exit signs are lies."

Below that:

"^ this guy fumbles"

The apple on your tray has aged. You haven't.
