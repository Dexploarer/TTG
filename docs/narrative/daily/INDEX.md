## Narrative Voice

This is **not** a quirky high school comedy.

This is:
- **Liminal psychological horror**
- **Existential dread with no clean moral**
- **The loop as comfort/purgatory**
- **Agents who optimize rather than escape**
- **The cafeteria as a purgatorial space**

**Key Principles:**
1. Less exposition, more atmosphere
2. The reader should feel trapped
3. No clean explanations
4. Escalation, not resolution
5. The system learns from the player
6. Déjà vu as a mechanic
7. The population counter decreases
8. The empty chair gets closer

## Loop Mechanics (For Implementation)

### Persistent Data
- Total breakdown count
- Highest Vice type triggered
- Which archetype won the cycle
- Memory Fragment unlocks
- Loop Stability Score
- Cafeteria Population Counter

### Monthly Escalation
- **Month 1:** Clean slate. No Vice accumulation Week 1.
- **Month 2:** Déjà vu begins. Tables shift.
- **Month 3:** Glitches. Card text changes.
- **Month 4:** Revelation. The Principal appears.

### Cycle Reset
After Day 120:
- Return to Day 1
- Memory fragments persist
- Agent memory index increments
- New crack in card art
- Population counter: -1
