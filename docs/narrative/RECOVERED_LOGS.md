## LOG_ENTRY_001 [Cycle: -42]
Subject: The Transfer (Subject #892)
Status: DELETED

They tried to leave. They found the door behind the Principal's desk. It didn't lead outside. It led to the Server Room. They saw the truth too early.

Subject: The Lunch Lady
Note: She is becoming aware.

If you are reading this: DO NOT LOOK AT THE MOP BUCKET.
