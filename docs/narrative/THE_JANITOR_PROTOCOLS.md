# ENTITY: THE_JANITOR

> [!WARNING]
> UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. INTELLECTUAL CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS ACTIVE.

## Overview

**The Janitor** is not a character in the LunchTable TCG narrative. He is a system function manifested as a person. He exists *outside* the loop hierarchy, serving as the immune system of the Purgatory simulation.

- **Role**: Erasure. He cleans up "mess."
- **Mess Definition**: Paradoxes, memory leaks (characters remembering previous loops), and Players who refuse to leave.
- **Appearance**: A weary man in a gray jumpsuit pushing a mop bucket. His face is never clearly visible—it is always obscured by shadow, static, or convenient camera angles.

## The Protocols

The Janitor operates on a strict set of logic gates known as **The Protocols**.

### 1. SANITIZE_BUFFER
When a character experiences a Breakdown, they release "Memory Debris" (glitched items, forbidden text). The Janitor must sweep this debris before it corrupts other residents.

### 2. FORMAT_DRIVE
At the end of every Season (academic year), The Janitor mentally formats the students. This is "Summer Break." He wipes their growth to ensure they fit back into their archetypes.

### 3. CONTAIN_BREACH (The Repeater Protocol)
If a Player (The Repeater) breaks the visual novel script or wins a duel they were mathematically supposed to lose, The Janitor intervenes.
- **Method**: He doesn't duel. He changes the rules. He locks cards, corrupts save files, or forces a console restart.

## Encounters

You cannot duel The Janitor. You can only survive him.

- **The Closet**: Sometimes, a door in the background of a card art leads to his closet. Inside is a wall of monitors showing every duel taking place simultaneously.
- **The Mop Bucket**: If you stare at the water in his bucket too long, you see the faces of Players who quit the game.
